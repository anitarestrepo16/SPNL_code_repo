This is an R Markdown document.    
For HW, we strongly recomment you "Knit" to PDF (not Word, not HTML).

The following is just a template.   
It's not related to any specific HW assignment

# Q1
This is question 1,

## (a)
which has a part (a)

## (b)
then part (b)

## (c)
and finally part (c)

# Q2
the next question is 2.

## (a)
It only has a part (a)

## (b)
and a part (b).

# Q3

Now, I'm just going to do a bunch of stuff in R Markdown that you
can use for ideas for formatting your work.

## (a)
Some of this I borrowed from the R Markdown (by RStudio) tutorial:   
[http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

## (b)
End a line with two spaces  
to start a new line. Plus, these two -- words are separated by a long dash.

Here is the start of the next paragraph where
**this text is bold,** whereas *this text is in italics*.
You can even ~~strikethrough text~~, although I can't think why you would need to.

> A long quote starts with a greater than sign and gets indented on both sides.  Well, only until you hit return to start a new line.  I think I'll just repeat that to demonstrate a long quote.  A long quote starts with a greater than sign and gets indented on both sides.  Well, only until you hit return to start a new line.

Finally, the quote is finished!

# Q4

## (a)
Here is an itemized list.
Leave a blank line before the list.
Indent using at least 4 spaces.

* item 1
* item 2
    + sub-item 1
    + sub-item 2
* item 3
    + sub-item 1
    
## (b)

Here is an ordered list.
Leave a blank line before the list.
Indent using at least 4 spaces.

1. item 1
2. item 2
    a. sub-item 1
    b. sub-item 2
3. item 3
    a. sub-item 1
    
# Q5 

## (a)

In R, I am assigning the number 4 to the variable `x`. 
...but you can't see that because the default is to **NOT** show R code.

The R chunk starts below.
```{r}
x <- 4
```
...and ends above.

## (b)

Here is a table (and I'll ask R display the values of `x` and `x^2` for me too).
To display values of R variables, type back-tick `r` (` `r`), then a space, then the variable name
(or a formula operating on the variable), then end it with another back-tick ` ` `.

Table Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Table Cell 1  | Cell 2
Cell 3        | Cell 4
$x = `r x`$       | $x^2= `r x^2`$

You can even line-up the text in your tables as you like.

Centered | Right-Justified | Left-Justified
:-------:|----------------:|:----------------
A        | 24              |  My Friend's Name
B        |  5              |  My Name
CC       | 167             |  Firstname Lastname
DDD      | 48              |  Another Name

# Q6

## (a)

Here are some plots where I don't display the R code.
You might notice that my plots get cropped.

```{r}
data(iris)
hist(iris$Petal.Length, nclass = 20)
plot(iris$Petal.Width, iris$Petal.Length)
```

Here, you can resize your plots by adjusting `fig.width` 
and `fig.height` in the code chunk.

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
hist(iris$Petal.Length, nclass = 20)
plot(iris$Petal.Width, iris$Petal.Length)
```

...and you can center, right-justify, or left-justify (default) your graphic.

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
plot(iris$Petal.Width, iris$Petal.Length)
```

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.align='right'}
plot(iris$Petal.Width, iris$Petal.Length)
```

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
plot(iris$Petal.Width, iris$Petal.Length)
```

## (b)

Now, here are two plots placed side-by-side.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold', out.width=c('45%', '45%')}
hist(iris$Petal.Length, nclass = 20)
plot(iris$Petal.Width, iris$Petal.Length)
```

Of course, I would comment on the plots right here so I 
get credit for them on my homework.
