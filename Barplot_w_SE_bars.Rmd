Create a barplot with Standard Error bars.  

```{r}
df %>% filter(!is.na(IV)) %>% # remove NAs in the IV
  group_by(factor(IV)) %>% # group by the IV of interest (and make sure R knows it's a factor)
  # calculate stats necessary to compute the standard error for each level of the IV
  summarise(mean = mean(DV, na.rm = TRUE), 
            n = n(),
            sd = sd(DV, na.rm = TRUE),
            se = sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  # now the actual plot
  ggplot(aes(x = `factor(IV)`, y = mean)) + # plot the means for each level of the IV
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + # make sure the bar plot is plotting what we tell it and not the count
  ggtitle("Plot Title") +
  xlab("IV") + 
  ylab("DV") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + # text size for the plot title
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se), width=0.2) + # use the standard error calculated above for each level of the IV and plot as error bars (+/- 1 SE)
  theme_classic() +
  # add significance bars with stars -- placed manually on plot with coordinates
  annotate("segment", x=1, xend=4, y = 5, yend=5) +
  annotate("text", label="***", x = 2.5, y=5.1) +
  annotate("segment", x=1, xend=3, y = 4.5, yend=4.5) +
  annotate("text", label="**", x = 2, y=4.6)
```
