A couple resources for coding and stats. Definitely a work in progress, feel free to add any and all useful links/titles/authors.  
  
# General Resources 
  
[R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)  
Asolutely stellar overview of the most useful elements in the tidyverse tailored for data science. Spans everything from manipulating data to basic text analysis to plotting with ggplot. A great resource for daily coding.  
  
[Datanovia website (Alboukadel Kassambara)](https://www.datanovia.com/en/)  
Contains really detailed and easy-to-follow step-by-step guides for common analyses including assumption checks and plotting results.  
  
[ggplot2 reference guide](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)  
The official reference guide for ggplot2 with all the documentation and, more importantly, thorough discussion of all possible options with examples.  
  
[R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)  
Great reference for the more specific and uncommon details of R Markdown.  
  
[Happy Git with R by Jenny Bryan](http://happygitwithr.com)  
Has some good stuff for learning to use github with R. A bit too detailed and in-depth for our needs I think but still a good resource to have!  
  
# HLM Resources  
  
These are mainly from Karen Smith.  
  
[Nice visualization to help understand](http://mfviz.com/hierarchical-models/)
  
## Tutorials  
[Longitudinal Analysis with lme](https://rpsychologist.com/r-guide-longitudinal-lme-lmer)  
  
[Linear mixed effects models in R](https://pagepiccinini.com/r-course/lesson-6-part-1-linear-mixed-effects-models/)  
  
[lme4 Tutorial](nsvandeschoot.com/tutorials/lme4/)  
  
[Another lme4 Tutorial](http://www.rensenieuwenhuis.nl/r-sessions-16-multilevel-model-specification-lme4/)
  
## Articles  
[A paper on HLM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3131138/)  
  
## Books  
[Applied Longitudinal Analysis Book](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Longitudinal-Data-Analysis-Occurrence/dp/0195152964)  
Highly recommended by Karen and has [accompanying R code](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/examples/alda/)
  
[Raudenbush's Book on HLM](https://www.amazon.com/Hierarchical-Linear-Models-Applications-Quantitative/dp/076191904X)
